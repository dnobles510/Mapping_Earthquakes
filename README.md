# Mapping_Earthquakes
# Purpose
The purpose of this repository was to track earthquakes from the past week and see the magnitudes of the different earthquakes in different parts of the world. Each earthquake is measured by circle marker size, so small circle markers equate to low magnitudes and big circle markers equate to high magnitudes.
